# mini Google Docs

Technology used:
- Quill
- React

TODO:
â€¢ Shared document editing, in the style of Google docs. The system should support real-time editing and
viewing by multiple participants. Multiple replicas would be maintained for fault tolerance. Caching
and/or copy migration would be useful to minimize application response time. [as in [requirement](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/15-440/F12/p3.pdf)]
